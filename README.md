# Sorting-give-data-set-by-quick-sort-algorithm
I was given a dataset where the music listening histories of the Twitter users between 2012-2013 are reported. The program sorts the tweets in case-sensitive alphabetical order in terms of the country. For the tweets with the same country name, sorts them in in case-sensitive alphabetical order in terms of the artist name. If both country name and the artist name are the same then sorts them in ascending order of tweet_unixtime. As a sorting algorithm, the program uses In-Place (without extra array for left and right partitions) Quicksort with both deterministic and randomized pivot selection.
